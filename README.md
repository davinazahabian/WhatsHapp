# WhatsHapp

WhatsHapp is an all-in-one application for USC students to find non-Greek life events that are happening on and off campus. 
Users can log in, post their own events, or filter through a feed of events based on category (student-run, club affiliated, 
school-wide, etc.). Users can click attending, maybe, or not attending on each posting on the feed, which is valuable for the 
user and the host. Filter events based on location and time, or search for whatever type of event.

To run WhatsHapp on your machine:
